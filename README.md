# WoW Crucible

> [!WARNING]
> WoW Crucible is in very early development. Back up your files and validate generated client/server changes before using them on a live project.

WoW Crucible is an open-source content-authoring toolkit for World of Warcraft 3.3.5a (build 12340). The long-term goal is one coherent workflow for DBC editing, patch MPQ creation, spells, items, creatures, races, classes, and current AzerothCore/TrinityCore 3.3.5 integration.

The client build is fixed, but server integration will not be tied to an old repack. The compatibility contract targets current AzerothCore `master` and current TrinityCore branch `3.3.5` through separate capability-driven adapters. See [docs/COMPATIBILITY.md](docs/COMPATIBILITY.md).

## What works today

- Opens and saves 3.3.5a `WDBC`/`.dbc` files directly.
- Uses a virtual, double-buffered grid suitable for large files such as `Spell.dbc`.
- Includes its own complete 234-column `Spell.dbc` schema and accepts external build-12340 definitions for generic tables.
- Stages multiple open DBC files at once and switches between them without reloading.
- Decodes known 3.3.5a enum and bit-flag fields into readable names, with raw mode and lossless enum/flag editors.
- Resolves and safely extends DBC string tables.
- Searches all fields in parallel.
- Edits strings, bytes, integers, unsigned values, raw 32-bit values, and floats.
- Creates blank records, clones records with a new ID, and deletes selected records.
- Uses geometric record capacity and single-allocation bulk cloning for large creation batches.
- Supports cell-level undo/redo with `Ctrl+Z` and `Ctrl+Y` (structural operations begin a new history).
- Provides a grouped Spell Workspace for general properties, costs, three effects, localized text, visuals, and links.
- Saves atomically and creates `.bak` files before overwriting data.
- Accepts DBC and patch-builder drag-and-drop.
- Builds WotLK patch MPQs from edited DBCs or existing folder trees.
- Displays editable internal MPQ paths and preserves folder hierarchy.
- Opens existing MPQ patches and safely adds or replaces files while keeping a `.bak` copy.
- Remembers server `data\\dbc` and WoW client `Data` paths for future open, sync, and patch dialogs.
- Allows explicit selection of the WotLK build-12340 schema XML and remembers separate base/override DBC layers.
- Writes handled and fatal crash details to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\WoWCrucible\\Logs` (also available through **Open Logs**).
- Browses large MPQs without loading file contents, filters paths instantly, and extracts selected files or whole archives in the background.
- Ships a scriptable `wowcrucible.exe` CLI for DBC information and MPQ list/extract/create/update operations.
- Compares layered DBC directories as base-only, override-only, identical, or genuinely overridden, with cancellable semantic row/field comparison (decoded strings do not differ merely because their offsets moved).
- Promotes selected fields or complete rows from an override DBC into an output DBC by record ID, safely re-interns strings, and saves/reapplies semantic promotion manifests.
- Saves portable patch manifests and builds fresh, tiny MPQs containing only listed DBC/UI changes.
- Treats an imported folder as the MPQ staging root and previews every editable source-to-archive mapping with suspicious-root warnings before building.
- Detects protected `Interface\\GlueXML` changes, warns that stock clients may reject them through `GLUEXML.TOC.SIG`, and can bind a patch manifest to the SHA-256 of a known-compatible `Wow.exe`.
- Enforces manifest allow/deny globs and exact entry counts, provides a dry-run source-to-archive listing, and verifies an existing MPQ for missing, unexpected, or size-mismatched content without rebuilding it.
- Refuses copy-update operations on archives larger than 2 GB; giant mod/client layers are immutable inputs, never working patch targets.

## Command line

```text
wowcrucible dbc info Spell.dbc
wowcrucible dbc validate "WotLK 3.3.5 (12340).xml" dbc-folder [--strict] [--recursive]
wowcrucible dbc compare base\Spell.dbc override\Spell.dbc "WotLK 3.3.5 (12340).xml"
wowcrucible dbc promote apply base\Spell.dbc override\Spell.dbc schema.xml selection.dbc-promotion.json output\Spell.dbc
wowcrucible mpq list patch.MPQ [filter]
wowcrucible mpq extract patch.MPQ output-folder [filter] [--quiet|--progress=N]
wowcrucible mpq create patch-W.MPQ file-or-folder [...]
wowcrucible mpq update patch-W.MPQ file-or-folder [...]
wowcrucible manifest create classless.json patch-W.mpq changed-files-folder [--allow=glob] [--deny=glob] [--count=N] [--client-exe=Wow.exe]
wowcrucible manifest list classless.json
wowcrucible manifest validate classless.json [existing-patch.mpq]
wowcrucible manifest build classless.json output-folder
```

MPQ listing can only display paths known to the archive's internal `(listfile)`. WoW client and normal mod archives generally include one; hash-only unnamed entries can still exist but cannot be assigned their original names by any MPQ browser without an external listfile.
- Maps standalone DBCs to `DBFilesClient\\<name>.dbc`.
- Synchronizes a saved DBC into a selected server `data\\dbc` directory with backup.

Specialized editors will follow the principles in [docs/UX-PRINCIPLES.md](docs/UX-PRINCIPLES.md): grouped fields, named flags, human-readable references, change previews, validation, and duplicate-first creation.

## Run

Requirements: Windows x64 and the .NET 10 SDK.

```powershell
dotnet run --project src/WoWCrucible.App/WoWCrucible.App.csproj
```

Open a DBC directly:

```powershell
dotnet run --project src/WoWCrucible.App/WoWCrucible.App.csproj -- "C:\path\to\Spell.dbc"
```

## Build

```powershell
dotnet build WoWCrucible.slnx -c Release
```

The corpus test runner accepts a WDBX 12340 definition XML and a directory containing extracted 3.3.5a DBC files. Copyrighted game data is intentionally not included.

## Roadmap

1. Bulk operations, validation, and project-wide ID allocation.
2. Expand the Spell Workspace with named flags, searchable references, and related-table navigation.
3. CSV import/export and target-aware SQL generation.
4. MPQ browsing and extraction.
5. Current AzerothCore and TrinityCore 3.3.5 server profiles.
6. Guided item, race, and class creation spanning required client and server records.
